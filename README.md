# How to make the Google form

1. Create a new Google form.
2. Make the question type "Checkbox grid".
3. Click the "..." next to "Require a response in each row" and
   click on "Limit to one response per column". This will ensure that
   the same ranking can't be used twice.
4. Enter candidate names under "Rows".
5. Enter rankings under "Columns".
